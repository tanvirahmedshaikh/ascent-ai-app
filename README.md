### Navigating the App

The application is structured into four main tabs, each designed for a specific part of the content creation workflow:

* **üìù Brand Strategy:**  
  A step-by-step process to define your professional brand.  
  You‚Äôll answer questions about your background, career goals, and desired positioning.  
  The AI then generates a detailed, multi-week content strategy tailored to your needs ‚Äî the starting point for building a long-term plan.

* **üí° Post Ideas:**  
  Your primary content creation hub. Once a strategy is approved, it populates with post ideas organized by theme.  
  You can refine existing ideas, generate more ideas for specific themes, or use the **Refine Selected Ideas** buttons to apply feedback across multiple themes.

* **‚ú® Quick Ideas:**  
  An on-demand, no-strategy-required workflow. You can generate single-post ideas or a 3-part series on any topic you choose.  
  This tab also allows you to save your favorite ideas to a history for later use.

* **‚úçÔ∏è Final Post:**  
  Your final workspace. Select any idea from the other tabs to have the AI write a full, polished draft. Here, you can:
  - Review a **Post Preview** styled like a real social media post.  
  - Get automated feedback from the **Quality Assurance Agent**.  
  - Provide your own feedback and refine the draft using the **Refine Draft** button.  
  - Save or download your final version.
